function et=initialize(et,eyeDataPath,window)
% this should initialize eyelink and set the data path.  If you can't
% initialize, check the following:

% 1. Are you on a station that has an eyetracker on it? if not, you can't
% run  a protocol that defines an eyetracker.  Leave that field empty in
% the trial manager. 

% 2. is the eye tracker turned on?  power the camera, and enter the command
% "t" on the command line of the eyeTracker computer.  Its okay if it says
% "offline - link closed" in the green box as long as the eyeLink software 
% is up and running.
%
% 3.  maybe you have not installed  the eyeLink software
% developers kit.  Here is how to set things up the first time:
%
% download and install lastest sdk from here:

% i installed 1.7.277 on the righthand computer in the small rig room.
%    https://www.sr-support.com/forums/showthread.php?t=172
% has the latest version of the installation guide.  i used 1.4.0.  it says what to do with the ip address.  section 9.1.5 says:
% Select the Use the following IP address radio button. Enter the IP
% address of 100.1.1.2. The last digit of the IP address can increase for other computers on the EyeLink network. Enter the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. Leave the default gateway and other setting blank.

% loadlibrary and my eyelinkExtraData/getExtendedEyelinkData are not needed, franz's stuff does everything.  my stuff was just an alternative before we knew franz would do it for us.
% works with 2007b at least.  but we haven't verified that franz's method
% for extracting the extended data wasn't broken when sol added the double CR data into the records.
% let's email sol and ask him if the stuff he and suganthan put for us in 1.5.1.104 and 1.5.1.272 all made it into the latest 1.7.277 that we download from https://www.sr-support.com/forums/showthread.php?t=6.  and also how the double CR data is supposed to be accessed.
